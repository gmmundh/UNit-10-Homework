For this project we analaysed the historical performance of the Japanese Yen compared to the Canadian Dollar. We utilised Time Series Analysis and Regression Models
to compare the historical performance and predict the future. As part of our analysis we also determined the volatility of the Foreign Exchange. The tools we utilised
were:
The Hedrock Prescott Filter - To split the trend and the noise. There was a clear trend in the data
We performed Forecasting using the ARMA and ARIMA Models which was not a good fit due to the P Value.
We then used the Arima model. I applied the Autoregressive and Moving Average Values of 1,1 rather than 5,1 as it provided lower BIC and AIC scores. I got the 1 and 1
based on looking at the graphs
We then applied the GARCh for volating prediction. The result was that volatility was increasing
We then used regression analysis to build a model to predict returns. Unfortuantely the model didnt seem to be predicting really well based on a visual graph and the Root Mean Square Error.
